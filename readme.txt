recently kl3 is working for the participation of school level students for the national robotics championship YANTRA 2.0
we have plannd to have demonstration programs in the 6 schools of the valley and has planned to selsct 24 students from those schools
in the group of 3; we have planed to train 24 students in total
the workshop planning has not started that well till now but we will soon have our meeting and decide the time required of the workshop and course design


talking about the spoken tutorial;
we are not being able to focus in the task due to the increase in the pressure of the curriculum and robotics course design
in order to fulfill our aim i.e. 3 for dipesh and 8 for mandira; we are palnnning to work a whole week on it
the task is also delayed due to unavailability of the space for the dobbing
